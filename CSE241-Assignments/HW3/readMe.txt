   This program works with movements like A 1, B 7, C 10 and works with commands like "SAVE FILE.TXT" or "LOAD FILE.TXT" that the user will enter.

   Because of I couldn't play 5 games at the same time, I created 2 Hex objects. When the 2 hex game was over, I printed the total number of marked 
   cells in these two games and the comparison of the number of marked cells in both games to screen.
